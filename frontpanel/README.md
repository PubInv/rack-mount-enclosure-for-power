# frontpanel
An aluminum plate on which the NASA-COG control system electrical intefaces are mounted from, and presented to the controlled elements.

## Details
Developed in FreeCAD

## First Front Panel Fabrication Notes

### Some deviations of note:
I drilled and tapped the holes for mounting the GFI receipticals for 6-32 screw holes and screwed the GFI from the rear with shortened screws. The protuding ends of these screews are a minor hazard for scratching flesh.  
I drilled and tapped the screw holes for 10-32 for mounting the ground bar.
I attached a single teathered connector cap for the Anderson connector with a plastic cable clamp to a near by screw mounting the circuit breaker.

### Cautions
There appears to be an error on the holes for the Anderson front panel connector mount. (20230326 FLE, Corrected before fabrication.)
