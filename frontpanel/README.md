# Frontpanel
An aluminum plate on which the NASA-COG control system electrical intefaces are mounted from, and presented to the controlled elements.
This front panel was later mounted to an enclosure defined in the enclosure folder.

## Details
Developed in FreeCAD
One FreeCAD drawing defins the **Frontpanel**, **Rearpanel** and **Bottompanel**. There is a drawing representing two DIN rails that may be mounted on the bottom panel.
Images of many parts to be mounted on the front panel are scaled and place in a group. This group can be displayed on the front panel to check the design and convey the resulting device.

## Second Front Panel Fabrication Notes
Fabrication of a Second controler beginning late July 2023.
Version 2 front panel.

### Some deviations of note:
I drilled and tapped the holes for mounting the GFI receipticals for 6-32 screw holes and screwed the GFI from the rear with shortened screws. The protuding ends of these screews are a minor hazard for scratching flesh.  
I drilled and tapped the screw holes for 10-32 for mounting the ground bar.
I attached a single teathered connector cap for the Anderson connector with a plastic cable clamp to a near by screw mounting the circuit breaker.  

?April 2023? Robert relocated the ground lug terminal strip inside the cabnet. Lee believes new holes had to be drilled.

### Cautions
There appears to be an error on the holes for the Anderson front panel connector mount. (20230326 FLE, Corrected before fabrication.)
