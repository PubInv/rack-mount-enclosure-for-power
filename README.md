## Front Panel and Enclosure Folders
A March 2023 enclosure for prototyping, proof of concept for the COG controller. 
This prototype has:
* A programmable power supply (Voltage and current), 
* Solid state relays for switching AC power to preheaters
* Power and PWM control for fans to force air into the COG
* Air Temperature and air flow rate sensors
* An Arduino Due for system control.
